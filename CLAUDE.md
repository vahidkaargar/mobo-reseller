## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
`caveman` (chat voice, default on, full), `absolute-mode`, `stop-slop` (persisted prose).
Provenance and pinned commits: `.claude/skills/SOURCES.md`.

## Commands
| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `composer install && npm install` (needs Flux Pro credentials in `auth.json`; requires PHP >= 8.4 and ext-mongodb ^2.1) |
| Dev server | `composer run dev` (serve + queue + pail + vite) |
| Tests | `php artisan test` or `vendor/bin/pest --filter=...` |
| Format | `vendor/bin/pint` (CI: `vendor/bin/pint` on PHP 8.4) |
| Static analysis | `composer analyse` (Larastan level 5, `phpstan-baseline.neon` holds 13 pre-existing errors) |
| Duplication | `npx --yes jscpd@5.4.0` (config `.jscpd.json`, fails above 7%) |
| Architecture | `vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/ArchTest.php` (Pest `arch()` rules) |
| All gates | `composer quality` |
| Git hook | `composer run hooks:install` links `.githooks/pre-commit` into `.git/hooks/` |
| Catalog sync | `php artisan bamboo:fetch-catalog` |

Required env beyond `.env.example`: Bamboo SDK credentials. Tests need a MongoDB server (`MONGODB_URI`).

## Cloud sessions
- Runtime: `.claude/cloud-setup.sh` (environment setup script) installs PHP 8.5 + ext-mongodb and MongoDB 8.0.
- `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` starts mongod and installs dependencies. If `composer.fluxui.dev` is
  unreachable it installs everything except `livewire/flux-pro` from untracked `composer.local.*` files;
  pages using Pro-only components (`flux:chart`, `flux:date-picker`) then fail to render locally. CI has Flux Pro.
- Laravel Boost MCP server: `.mcp.json` (`php artisan boost:mcp`). Regenerate guidelines and skills with
  `php artisan boost:install --guidelines --skills --mcp -n`; it rewrites the block between
  `<laravel-boost-guidelines>` tags below, so keep project rules above it.
Never commit `.env` or `auth.json` (both gitignored).

## Map
- `app/Services/` pricing (`FeeCalculatorService`), cart (`CartService`), FX (`ExchangeService`), catalog, suppliers.
- `app/Enums/` statuses and `SuppliersEnum` (supplier -> catalog strategy).
- `app/Console/Commands/FetchBambooCatalog.php` catalog import and product normalization.
- `resources/views/livewire/` Volt pages: `orders/`, `wallets/`, `admin/`, `developers/`, `settings/`, `auth/`.
- `routes/web.php` all app routes; `routes/api.php` exists but is not registered.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4 (CI and production; composer.lock requires PHP >= 8.4). Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists, including path-scoped framework guidelines under `.ai/rules/boost`. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.
- Activate the `deploying-to-cloud` skill whenever deploying to Laravel Cloud, configuring Cloud environments or resources, using the Cloud CLI, or troubleshooting Cloud deployments.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project uses the streamlined Laravel 11+ structure: register middleware, exceptions, and routing in `bootstrap/app.php` and service providers in `bootstrap/providers.php`. There is no `app/Http/Kernel.php` or `app/Console/Kernel.php`, and commands in `app/Console/Commands/` auto-register.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.

- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== volt/core rules ===

# Livewire Volt

- Single-file Livewire components: PHP logic and Blade templates in one file.
- Always check existing Volt components to determine functional vs class-based style.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Volt documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `volt-development` every time you're working with a Volt or single-file component-related task.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

# Pest

- This project uses Pest. Create tests with `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.
- Do not delete tests or test files without approval. They are part of the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `php artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/pest` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.
- After the feature tests pass, ask the user to run the complete suite with `php artisan test --compact`.
